HDFC Loan Approval Prediction System
Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting loan approval decisions. It simulates a real-world banking workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
The system is designed with separation between training and prediction modules, along with saved preprocessing artifacts for consistent deployment.

Problem Statement
Loan approval decisions depend on multiple applicant features such as income, credit history, employment status, and financial background.

This project builds a predictive model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on historical data.
